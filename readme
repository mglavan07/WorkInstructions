WorkInstructions is the main GitHub repository for storing all program, image, instruction, and drawing files related to the Final Assembly Project. If additional file types are added (e.g. sensor calibration, data logs, etc.) they will be labeled here. All existing branches are:

1. "main"

"main" branch stores all files, sorted and named according to convention

2. "ImportHere"

"ImportHere" branch stores all imported files, needed to be locally downloaded and reuploaded to "main" with the correct Git module commands, accessible via the Python file

Contents in "main" are named according to convention:
Repository Address: \WorkInstructions\main\PartNO\<filename>
Filename: FileType_PartNO_< Index NO > 

Example: Stored JLG Image 7 for Part NO 7702559
Repository Address: \WorkInstructions\main\7702559\<AnnotatedImage_7702559_7.png>
Filename: AnnotatedImage_7702559_7.png

NOTE: Program Files are not located in folders, rather they are exist in "main" with naming convention
Example: Python file for file uploads [version 1]
Repository Address: \WorkInstructions\main\<Program_CameraRoll2Repo_1.py>
Filename: Program_CameraRoll2Repo_1

NOTE: stand alone files, such as instructions or drawings, will be stored without a FileType folder, but lie within the same repository location as the FileType folders (up to PartNO). These files will follow file naming convention. 

EDIT: all program files and important files requiring download to run applications and models will be under DOWNLOADME_<description> folders in "main"
